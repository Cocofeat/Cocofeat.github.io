<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Research Fellow at National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Assistant Professor: Tham Yih Chung](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/medoph/invision/about-us-our-team-tham-yc.html). I received my Ph.D. from the National Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science on Synthetic Vision, the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, co-advised by [Prof. Xiaojing Shen](https://math.scu.edu.cn/info/1013/5806.htm) and [Prof. Xuedong Yuan](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1359/17827.htm). I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore from September 2022 to September 2023, under the supervision of [Principal Scientist: Huazhu Fu](https://hzfu.github.io/). 

- üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on __Trustworthy multi-modality learning__ with uncertainty estimation.
- ‚ö° I'm seeking to research on __Foundation model__.

****
## His research focuses on: 
* üî• **AI+ Healthcare**: Medical image analysis, uncertainty estimation, multi-modal learningÔºåvision-language model.
* **Computer Vision**: Point set registration.
* **Intelligent Vehicle**: Track2track association, multi-sensor fusion (lidar and camera).
